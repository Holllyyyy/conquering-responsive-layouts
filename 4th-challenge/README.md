## Overview

In this challenge I had to :

- The headings in the first row must be a different color
- The two .col at the bottom must go next to one another
- The section at the bottom should have a dark background color and a different color of text
- It's removed the "gap" that he created, so I'll have to add it back in

### What I learned

While working on this challenge I learned :

- In this challenge I had issue with background color of the last div, cause it couldn't be of 100%, actually cause earlier in the container I set different, so I used section for both columns. I made two sections and that's what made my issue to be fixed.
- Here I learned more how I can actually write flexbox , and how much parents and children I should have it to make it all good.
