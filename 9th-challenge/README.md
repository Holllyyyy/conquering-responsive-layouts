## My process

In my html file I started first by writing section, and in each section I gave class container, and class container row for rest 3 cause there i have 2 columns. So my columns I put it in div and in class of col.

In my CSS, I start writing for mobile view first, I added some font sizes, colors,background colors to each section.
For class container I gave width of 85 % and max width of 1128. container is inside of each of my sections.

For desktop view, i needed to use my class row what is div who is parent of two my children col. I added here display flex.
For my columns , my class .col I added width of 100% so I ll give space between two of them.
Also col + col with margin left so only on right side will move element, like here my other div of class coll moved.
