## Overview

In this challenge I had to :

- Keep the text inside .intro-content in the same place, but have the background extend from one side of the viewport to the other, no matter how wide or narrow the browser is.

- Limit the maximum width of the text in the bottom area.

### What I learned

While working on this challenge I learned how make background color to be extend from one side of the viewport to the other,no matter how wide or narrow the browser is.
I used width of 100% and max-width of 100vw for it in parent what is div class container. And for my children, i used with of 50% as well as max-width of 50%. Here I separated in two parents and children, but also all could be done in one main div (parent).
