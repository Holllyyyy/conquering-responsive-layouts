### What I learned

While working on this challenge I learned :

- how make use box-sizing. If we use it all inside this border-box will count. Our margin,padding,height,width. Without it is much harder to use, but with this we can handle all content.
- I used padding like this at first padding: 150px 50px 0 100px; this is not responsive , this made me issuses on small devices, so i needed to change it, my content gone to much right and left side was empty.
- When I made button I needed to use display inline-block.
